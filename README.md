# StuddyBuddy (name is work in progress)

## Proposal

This project will be a tool for students to create and organize question banks to help them study. Students will be able
to enter a question and an answer and add it to a question bank, then use said bank to quiz themselves and recieve a
result. I hope to add the ability to save and create multiple question banks so that students can organize their banks
per subject, and potentially track their progress over time. Ideally students would also be able to insert images for
questions. I chose this project as I think it's something I'd actually use and could benefit students immensely, as
repetition and quizzing is a vital part of the studying process. Hopefully I can use my project to save my grades this
semester!

## User Stories

- As a user, I'd like to be able to create and add a question to a question bank
- As a user, I'd like to be able to remove a question from a question bank
- As a user, I'd like to be able to view all of the questions in my bank
- As a user, I'd like to be able to take a quiz featuring all of the questions in my bank, and recieve a score back.
- As a user, I'd like to be able to save my questions and close the application
- As a user, I'd like to be prompted to load my old questions when I start the application

## Phase 4: Task 3

If I could refactor my code I think I would alter the way the quiz functionality works in the GUI. In its current form a new window pops up for every new question,
but I think a more user-friendly implementation would have one quiz window. I think I overused windows in some of my implementations. As for the backend aspect of my code, I can't think of any ways it could be refactored for improved efficiency.
