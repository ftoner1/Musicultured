# StuddyBuddy (name is work in progress)

## Proposal

This project will be a tool for students to create and organize question banks to help them study. Students will be able to enter a question and an answer and add it to a question bank, then use said bank to quiz themselves and recieve a result. I hope to add the ability to save and create multiple question banks so that students can organize their banks per subject, and potentially track their progress over time. Ideally students would also be able to insert images for questions.
I chose this project as I think it's something I'd actually use and could benefit students immensely, as repetition and quizzing is a vital part of the studying process. Hopefully I can use my project to save my grades this semester!
